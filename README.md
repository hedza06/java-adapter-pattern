# Java Adapter Pattern

Project illustrates use of Adapter Pattern which is part of Structural Group of Patterns.

Adapter Pattern works as bridge between two incompatible interfaces. Also,
it combines the capability of two independent interfaces.

## Pitfalls

- No too much!
- Too many adapters
- Do not complicate adapters
- Do not add new functionality to adapters (if you need this please consider Decorator pattern)
